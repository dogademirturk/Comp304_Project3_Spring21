To run part1, please write "make p1" in the terminal and watch the results of part1 in the terminal.
 
To run part2 with FIFO algorithm, please write "make p2fifo" in the terminal and watch the results of FIFO in the terminal.

To run part2 with LRU algorithm, please write "make p2lru" in the terminal and watch the results of LRU in the terminal.

Simply writing "make" wil compile and create executables for both of the c files. You can clean both of these executables by writing "make clean".

This program has all the components that we were asked to implement. It successfully executes part 1 and part 2. It successfully executes FIFO and LRU algorithms in the part2. For the LRU algorithm, a doubly linked list structure has been implemented. For the FIFO, simple modulo operation was enough to solve the algorithm.
